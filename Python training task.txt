Assignment:
Create a simple Python script that makes a search for a keyword on a user-given web url. As a result the script should return the 
time (in milliseconds) it took for the script to finish and whether the keyword was found on the received page (OK/NOK).

The url and the search keyword should be given as command line parameters
1. parameter: url
2. parameter: the search keyword

For example, to search http://www.hs.fi/ for the word 'urheilu', the user would give the following command on the command line:
> python web_search.py http://www.hs.fi/ urheilu


Bonus 1:
Make input validation for the user-given command line parameters. Check at least that the correct number of parameters is given.
Also, print a user friendly error message that advices the user in the correct usage.


Bonus 2:
Enhance the script to 'ping' the url periodically with a user defined time interval (3. parameter)


Bonus 3:
Modify the script to handle multiple urls on each run. The urls and respective search keywords should be read from a separate config file.
The format of the config file can be implemented freely.


Bonus 4:
Log the results to a separate log file.
The log file should contain the following information on each entry:
1. The current timestamp
2. The url searched
3. The search result (OK/NOK)
4. The time it took to complete the search.
Think how to represent the information in a readable way even when the data amount grows.

Some tips:
-Make use of Python's extensive module library. There is no need to reinvent the wheel.
